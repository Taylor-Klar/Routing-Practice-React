The goal of this assignment was to create a React app that can handle the following routes:
<li>localhost:3000/home: This should display the home page, with a generic "Welcome!" heading</li>
<li>localhost:3000/4: This should display the number "4", or any other number that was sent through</li>
<li>localhost:3000/hello: This should display the word "hello" or any other word that was sent through</li>
<li>localhost:3000/hello/blue/red: This should display the word "hello" in blue text with a red background. It should work with any other valid word and colors</li>
